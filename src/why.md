## Why are you doing this?

Monterey depends on the dollars tourism brings, and part of the deal of living in a tourist town is you will get a busy season. There is sometimes a lot of traffic and minor inconvinences that come with being a tourist town.

I get it, and when you compare the problems of living in a tourist economy compared to say, a boom-and-bust sardine fishery, we have it pretty good.

But **Monterey Car Week** doesn't just bring tourists. It brings assholes. **Assholes with fancy cars**.

Every local has experienced being cut off on the highway or almost run over crossing the street. One day someone is going to be hurt or killed because an asshole wanted to compensate for the emptyness they feel inside by driving their Ferrarri at 90mph on Lighthouse.

Pace car programs are actually administered by [several](https://) [cities](https://) and [police departments](https://) across the country to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the rules. Maybe if we all model good driving and physically prevent the assholes from driving too fast, we can prevent them from doing further harm.
