Every year, **Monterey Car Week** brings together the world's most exclusive cars and their owners. 

Unfotunately, these owners **drive like dicks**.

You can help by becoming an **Official Monterey Car Week Pace Car**. Just pledge to follow these specific rules **when being followed by a very nice car** during Monterey Car Week:

- Drive at least 5 mph below the speed limit, when safe to do so
- Make a very complete stop at every stop sign. Look left. Look right. Look left again.
- Don't turn right on a red light.
- If tailgated, drive slower.
